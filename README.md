# PR2 and Baxter Light Field Collection

Contains methods for collecting light fields using a USB camera or built-in camera with the PR2 and Baxter robot platforms.

Specifically, the end-effector of each robot traces out a particular shape specific to light field parameterizations:
* Spherical (2 Sphere Parameterization)
* Cylindrical (2 Cylinder Parameterization)
* Planar (2 Plane Parameterization)

## Renderer

A renderer was built to take advantage of two of the parameterizations, the 2PP and 2SP.

## Robot Calibration

End-effector calibration was completed using a laser attached to the camera affixed to the end-effector of the robot being studied.
